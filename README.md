Daw-JS

I'm curious about recording audio in the browser, and how one could maybe make a DAW or something; maybe it's not very feasible though. Even like an Electron/Tauri app or something in Node with the CLI could be kind of interesting.

How do native apps deal with audio? If it's backed by a native implementation, couldn't it be something web-based like this as well?
